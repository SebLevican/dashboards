I have created this dashboard using only DAX functions. The dashboard consists of three sheets: Revenue, Returns, and Channels.

Overall, this dashboard filters values where there are no revenues, compares sales or orders with the previous year, and highlights whether they are higher or lower. 
The Returns tab includes a range selector that adjusts the total value of returned products, allowing you to observe how total revenue would be affected.
